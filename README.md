# cs171-pr-oysters

This is a visualization based on Chesapeake Bay water quality data that explores the link between water quality measures and the oyster population to demonstrate the important role oysters play in keeping the water clean. The visualization also highlights concerning trends that are occurring due to increased pollution and a dramatic decrease in the oyster population.

This project was created in D3 and TopoJSON (for the map of the Chesapeake Bay), and all visualizations are linked and interactive. Data for water quality measures (nitrogen, phosphorous, disolved oxygen, PH, water temperature, salinity, and water clarity depth) can be viewed by year, month, or individually compared by measurement station.
